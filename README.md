# Breast_Cancer_EDA
This repository contains Python code and analysis for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of breast cancer dataset. The EDA aims to understand the characteristics of the dataset and identify factors relevant for predicting breast cancer diagnosis.

Contents:

Python_EDA.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing Python code for performing EDA on the breast cancer dataset.
Breast_Cancer_Data.csv: CSV file containing the breast cancer dataset used for analysis. It includes features such as radius_mean, perimeter_mean, smoothness_mean, symmetry_mean, fractal_dimension_mean, radius_worst, texture_worst, smoothness_worst, and concave_points_worst.
Project_Report.pdf: Detailed report answering specific questions related to the dataset's features and their distributions, outliers, relevant factors for predicting breast cancer diagnosis, and limitations of the data.
